# ============================================================
# DATA PREPARATION SCRIPT – MEASLES / MMR DASHBOARD (TEMPLATE)
# ============================================================
#
# Purpose
# -------
# This script prepares and cleans the datasets used by the
# Midwest EpiView: Measles dashboard. It merges vaccination
# records with geographic shapefiles, reconciles facility
# identifiers, and produces the standardized objects the Shiny
# app expects.
#
# ADAPTING THIS SCRIPT TO ANOTHER STATE
# -------------------------------------
# This was built for Minnesota data, but it is intended as a
# template. Almost everything that is state-specific has been
# lifted into the CONFIG block below. To adapt it:
#
#   1. Set STATE and the input file paths in CONFIG.
#   2. Replace the ID-format and organization-filter values in
#      CONFIG with your state's conventions (see notes there).
#   3. Remap your raw column names to the names this script
#      expects (see the "Expected input columns" notes in CONFIG
#      and the README data-format section).
#
# The app itself only cares about the OUTPUT objects and their
# columns (see "OUTPUT CONTRACT" in CONFIG). However your raw
# data is shaped, the goal is to produce those objects with
# those columns.
#
# Input data files are NOT included in this repository. The
# `data/` folder must be supplied separately from your state's
# public health / education / geospatial sources.
#
# Data Sources (Minnesota example)
# --------------------------------
# • Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) immunization reports
# • Minnesota Department of Education (MDE) program location
#   shapefiles
# • Minnesota Geospatial Commons county boundaries

# CONFIG — EDIT THIS BLOCK FOR YOUR STATE
# ============================================================

# ---- State ----
# Two-letter postal abbreviation, used to pull county boundaries
# from the Census (via tigris). NOTE: tigris downloads from the
# Census API at runtime, so this step requires internet access.
STATE       <- "MN"
COUNTY_YEAR <- 2022   # Census TIGER/Line vintage for county shapes

# ---- Input file paths ----
# All inputs live under data/. Replace with your state's files. 
# See README for the required format of each file.

# ---- Output directory ----
# The app loads .RData files from here. 
OUT_DIR <- "App Data"

# ---- Facility ID format (STATE-SPECIFIC) ----
# Minnesota builds a 12-digit school ID from shapefile fields as:
#   ORGTYPE(2) + ORGNUMBER(4) + SCHNUMBER(3) + "000" = 12 chars
# Your state almost certainly uses a different identifier scheme.
# Adjust ID_PAD_WIDTH and the id-construction step in the school
# section below to match how YOUR vaccination records and YOUR
# location shapefile can be made to share a common key.
ID_PAD_WIDTH <- 12

# ---- Organization / program filters (STATE-SPECIFIC) ----
# These select which records in the MN school location shapefile
# count as in-scope K-12 schools (vs. districts, libraries, early
# childhood, etc.). The codes below are Minnesota MDE codes and
# will NOT mean anything in another state — replace with your own
# in-scope criteria, or remove the filter entirely if not needed.

# ============================================================
# OUTPUT CONTRACT — what the Shiny app requires
# ============================================================
# The app sources these objects from the four .RData files and
# reads the columns listed. Adapt freely upstream, but the final
# objects must provide these:
#
#   county_map_data   : county_lower, county_name, full_vax,
#                       full_vax_pct, total_enrollment,
#                       students_of_color, frl_eligible, geometry
#   measles_cases     : county, year, n_cases, age_group
#   mn_counties       : county_lower, county_name, fips, geometry
#   daycare_joined    : daycare_name, idsch, COUNTYNAME,
#                       full_vax, full_vax_pct, enroll_mmreligible,
#                       geometry
#   school_demo_joined: school_name, mde_school_id, COUNTYNAME,
#                       GRADERANGE, full_vax, full_vax_pct,
#                       total_enrollment, geometry
#   mmr_grade         : mde_school_id, grade, full_vax_pct
#
# Coverage values may be numeric or "blurred" strings (e.g. ">95");
# the app handles both. Small-cell suppression / blurring should be
# applied to the SAVED data, not only at display time.
